	<p> My name is Abtin Ravanipour, I'm not very good at these. Like honestly, this will likely take more time than the project and CSS itself. Literally just sitting in class, looking around. My ankles are cold because my socks are too short, my back hurts a bit. </p>


	<p>That's all. Good day sir/madame</p>
